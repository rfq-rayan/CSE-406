# Real-Time Website Detection - Side-Channel Attack Demo

This folder contains a powerful demonstration of real-time website fingerprinting using side-channel attacks and machine learning.

## üéØ What This Demo Does

This Flask application demonstrates how an attacker could potentially identify which website a user is visiting in real-time by analyzing side-channel timing data from the browser. It showcases the privacy implications of website fingerprinting attacks.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Analyzes browsing patterns in real-time
- **Machine Learning**: Uses trained CNN models for classification
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Beautiful, modern UI for demonstrations
- **Side-Channel Analysis**: Collects timing data using browser APIs
- **Demo Mode**: Test with sample data for educational purposes

## üî¨ How It Works

1. **Timing Collection**: The app collects side-channel timing data from browser performance APIs
2. **Pattern Analysis**: A trained Convolutional Neural Network analyzes the timing patterns
3. **Website Fingerprinting**: The model identifies unique timing signatures for different websites
4. **Real-Time Classification**: Predicts which website the user is likely visiting

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
