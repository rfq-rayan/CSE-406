### Key Observations
1. **Perfect classification** for Prothom Alo website (100% precision and recall)
2. **Moderate performance** for BUET Moodle and Google (50% each)
3. **Overall accuracy of 66.7%** is reasonable given the small dataset size
4. **Complex model outperformed** the basic model by 16.7%

### Files Generated
- `saved_models/basic_model.pth` - Basic CNN model weights
- `saved_models/complex_model.pth` - Complex CNN model weights (best performing)

### Technical Implementation
- ✅ Custom PyTorch Dataset class for loading trace data
- ✅ Stratified train-test split to maintain class balance
- ✅ 1D Convolutional Neural Networks for sequence classification
- ✅ Batch normalization and dropout for regularization
- ✅ Adam optimizer with learning rate 1e-4
- ✅ Cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification
- ✅ Comprehensive evaluation with classification reports
- ✅ Model saving and comparison

### Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Collect more data**: 30 traces is quite small; 100+ per website would be better
2. **Data augmentation**: Apply noise, scaling, or time-warping to increase diversity
3. **Feature engineering**: Extract statistical features from raw traces
4. **Ensemble methods**: Combine multiple models for better performance
5. **Hyperparameter tuning**: Optimize learning rate, batch size, architecture
