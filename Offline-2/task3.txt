In this task, you will implement automation to collect a substantial dataset of website
fingerprints. The starter code includes a partially implemented Selenium script (collect.py)
and a database module (database.py) that uses SQLite to store collected traces.
Selenium is a powerful browser automation tool that allows you to programmatically
control web browsers. We’ll use it to automatically open different websites and collect their
fingerprinting traces.
As you run your experiments, you will notice they will take a long time to complete.
Your system might shutdown or the browser might crash unexpectedly. We do not want
to lose our data in any such event. So, we will use a SQLite database to store our traces.
Conveniently for you, the starter code already includes a database module database.py that
uses SQLite to store collected traces. You will integrate this module into your automation
script to ensure that all collected traces are stored reliably.


For this task you will have to:
1. Complete the data collection functions in collect.py to:
• Start the Flask server if it’s not already running
• Open the fingerprinting page in one browser tab
• Open one of the target websites (like prothomalo.com, buet.ac.bd, google.com) in
another tab
• Simulate user activity by scrolling randomly on the target website
• Trigger trace collection on the fingerprinting page
• Download the trace data
• Repeat for multiple websites and multiple times per website
2. Store the collected trace data reliably in a database by integrating database.py.
3. Test your implementation by collecting at least 10 traces for each of 3 different websites




Implementation Requirements
✓ Implement robust automation that can run unattended for extended periods
✓ Ensure proper error handling to prevent crashes during long collection runs
✓ Store collected traces in the SQLite database with appropriate metadata
✓ Implement a clean shutdown procedure that saves all data before exiting
✓ Document any browser-specific configurations needed for your solution
